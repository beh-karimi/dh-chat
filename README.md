# DISCLAIMER
This program is just a practice to implement various cryptography techniques and algorithms, the key size alone is enough to make the encryption *EXTREMELY* insecure, let alone the encryption algorithm and key expansion (the key just gets repeated).

**DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE THIS PROGRAM FOR ANYTHING REMOTELY SENSITIVE!** The encryption is hardly any better than no encryption at all.

# DH-Chat
This is a very simple terminal program that implements cryptography from ground up. I mainly made this project to implement the diffie-helman protocol myself, but decided to learn other stuff as well such as:
- Other cryptographic algorithm and techniques
- Working with Tokio
- Making a TUI from ground up.
- Managing a not-small project and keeping it clean (clearly failing)
